# The Task

* Read the users from the xml, csv and json files within the `data` directory
* Merge all users into a single list and sort them by their `userId` in ascending order
* Write the ordered results to new xml, csv and json files, see the `examples` directory
  * Results should use the same structure as the source files they were parsed from
  * The exception is for `lastLoginTime` where an `ISO 8601` date format is preferred for output


# Requirements

* Use any Object Oriented language you prefer
* Please provide a solution that best showcases your OO design abilities, and representative of how you would work

* Please make a note of what you skipped or not implemented at all, and why

# Evaluation

* The main 3 evaluation criteria will be: 
    * OO design/principles
    * Code reuse and duplication
    * Tests

# Submitting your solution

Either:
* Zip up your solution (omitting the vendor folder)
* After committing your changes, create a git bundle from your local repo with:
```
git bundle create solution.bundle master
```
